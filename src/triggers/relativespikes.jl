# Convert a PhyOutput to a relativeSpikes struct


"""
    relativespikes(p::PhyOutput, stimtrain::Dict{String,T}, back, forward) where {T<:Real}

Returns a `RelativeSpikes` struct which contains `RelativeCluster`s and contains only spiketimes occuring `back` before triggers or `forward` after them.
Spiketimes are represented relative to the trigger event. For example a spike occuring 10ms before the trigger will appear as -300 if the sample rate
is 30 000Hz

# Arguments

All arguments representing time may be provided in a `Unitful.jl` unit or the samplerate of the experiment.
If one time is provided in a `Unitful` unit of time the others will have to be provided as such as well.

- `p::PhyOutput` -- A PhyOutput struct.
- `stimtrain` -- A `Dict` describing each trigger event. For example `Dict("US" => 0u"ms", "CS" => 300u"ms")` would mean one event (CS) at trigger and another (US) 300ms after trigger.
- `back` -- Time before trigger to include in each spike train.
- `forward` -- Time after trigger to include in each spike train.
