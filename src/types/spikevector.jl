Struct for holding spiketimes relative to some trigger as well as their samplerate.

The spiketimes themselves are held in a `Vector{Vector{T}}` (A vector of vectors) where the inner vector `n` holds spiketimes relative to the `n`:th trigger event.

Since this is not a mutable struct the sample rate cannot be changed in-place. The spiketimes themselves may however be changed since they are stored in a mutable `Vector{T}`.
For conversion to a new sample rate, creating a new instance of `RelativeSpikeVector` using [`LaskaCore.convertsamplerate`](@ref) is recommended.

# Indexing

Since this is essentially just a vector of vectors it can be indexed as `vec[i][j]` where `i` refers to the `i`:th trigger events and `j` to the `j`:th spiketime tied to that trigger event.
